    "## Overview\n",
    "This document covers the basics of device communication and configuration. OpenSync devices employ USB on-the-go (OTG), so no drivers are necessary to communicate with an OpenSync device. This is beneficial as device discovery revolves arounds a computer's ability to detect a USB device that is actively connected to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to search, connect, and \"talk\" to an OpenSync device. OpenSync relies on a stable USB connection, so make sure one is present for this demonstration."

    "Two of the more important functions for OpenSync are `device_system_fire` and `device_system_stop`. `device_system_fire` executes a pulse sequence with the current pulse and clock configrations. To prematurely stop a pulse sequence iteration, one can use `device_system_stop` and an abort signal will be sent to the OpenSync device. OpenSync allows for one to repeat a pulse sequence up to 500,000 times allowing for up to 500,000 image pairs to be collected during an experiment.\n",

Setting debug levels should be a last resort when troubleshooting your device. A quick reference for debug levels is given below.\n",
