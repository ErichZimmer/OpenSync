    "## Overview\n",
    "This document covers the basics of configuring a pulse sequencer using the SCPI interface of an OpenSync device. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to communicate an OpenSync device using its SCPI interface and configure a pulse sequencer using the raw commands. It is assumed that you have some fundamental knowledge of how SCPI commands work. If not, then one can read the basics [here](). Additionally, OpenSync relies on a stable USB connection, so make sure one is present for this demonstration."

    "## Configuring a Pulse Sequencer\n",
    "A pulse sequencer on an OpenSync device outputs a pulse sequencer through eight (8) output channels. It is only concerned with producing an output sequence once an internal trigger is recieved and not where that signal came from or its repitition frequency. A pulse sequencer synthesizes a pulse sequence through output states and delays to the next output state change. An output state is merely the bit pattern of high and low pins (e.g., the output channels) at a given time. The delay between output states is measured in the current pulse sequencer's data units. The data units are not really in physical units per se. For instance, setting the data units to `microsecond` and querrying the units would not return microseconds. Instead, it will return a number representing the unit conversion to the base time scale in nanoseconds (for microseconds, this is 1e3). The same thing can be said about the clock divider (DIVider command in SCPI). The timing resolution is given by multiplying the base time scale with the clock divider. So, setting the clock divider to `low_res` would return a value such as 25. It is important to keep these considerations in mind when configuring a pulse sequencer."

The following pulse sequence will look like the following.\n",

    "Since the sequencer changes output states per instruction, we can think of it as a snapshot of the pulse sequence at a given time. For every snapshot, the output state changes. Focusing on the output changes, we can see the there is an output state change at 0 seconds, 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, and 5 seconds. This will serve as our delay instructions when we get to it. Now, we can focus on what values the output state instructions need to be. The output states are stored as an integer representation of an 8 bit number. So, we can convert the output state changes to the following instructions:\n",
    " - '00000001' --> 1\n",
    " - '00000011' --> 3\n",
    " - '00000010' --> 2\n",
    " - '00000100' --> 4\n",
    " - '00000000' --> 0\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now pair the output state changes with the delays to those output snapshots. Note, a delay of zero will set the instruction delay to the smallest supported instruction delay.\n",

    "| 00000100 | 4 | 2 |\n",
    "| 00000000 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we got out instructions, we can send them to the OpenSync device. Instructions are not sent directly to the pulse sequencer. Instead, they are sent into a static cache buffer where they are stored, checked, and applied to a pulse sequencer. This is important to acknowledge since a pulse sequencer's instructions are not updated automatically."
