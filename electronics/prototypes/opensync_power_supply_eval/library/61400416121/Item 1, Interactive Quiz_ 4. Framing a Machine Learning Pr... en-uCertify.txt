Question 1 :
A business stakeholder has approached you about creating a model to
recommend items to users. However, although she has data about the users
themselves, she does not have any labels. As a data scientist, which of
the following options would you recommend to her to get started with
most quickly?

This type of question contains radio buttons and checkboxes for
selection of options. Use Tab for navigation and Enter or space to
select the option.

A

Train a classification model to predict the item for each user.

Start simple by building a clustering algorithm that clusters the users
into groups. Recommend items to new users based on the items purchased
by users in their cluster.

C

All ML problems require labels, so she should spend the next 6 months
first getting labeled data users have purchased before building an ML
model.

D

All machine learning problems require labels; since she does not have
labels, this problem is not an ML use case.


Explanation

Answer B is correct.

Option D is wrong since ML problems don't require labels, that is,
unsupervised learning. Option C is wrong because that approach will
greatly delay her timeline for production. Option A is wrong because
there are no labels available. Thus, B is the best option.
