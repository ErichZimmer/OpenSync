# OpenSync System Development Life Cycle
Welcome to OpenSync's SDLC directory!

## What is this?
SDLC is a subset of project management that covers from the initial feasibility study to the deprecation of an active product. In the context of this repository, SDLC is used to document the process of developing and mantaining an open-source synchronizer (OpenSync) for the velocimetry of fluids. Interested readers that want to know more about the philosophy and design considerations that went into this project are encouraged to read through the publicly made documents published in this directory. Please note that these documents are not really citable and have not been peer-reviewed what-so-ever.
