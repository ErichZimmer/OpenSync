Today (October 25, 2025), I tested the firmware on a "old" RP2040 microcontroller via the o.g. pico dev board. Everything passed testing except for the external trigger assembly program which seems to need a little help. This shouldn't be too hard especially since I got a new osciliscope in yesterday on top of the simplicity of the PIO subset of the assembly language (totally does not give me flashbacks to computer architecture clases and multimedia extensensions). Anyhow, here is a demo using the freerun mode on output and clock channel zero.
